# Technical problems that I encountered during installation and use of MongoDB and how I resolved


# The correct validation of the installation package (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/verify-mongodb-packages/)


# Relevant results obtained during Experiment 1 (it is not necessary to put a single screenshot on each substep, but at least one significant from each CRUD operation).


# Experiment 2 example working and the additional Map-reduce operation (and its result) developed by each of you.


# Reason about why I implemented Map-reduce operation in Experiment 2 is useful and interpret the collection obtained.


# Any pending issues with this assignment which I did not manage to solve
