In this experiment I deployed a small Java application in the cloud using the Heroku cloud application platform: https://www.heroku.com

I created an account on Heroku.

Completed the tutorial for deploying Java applications on the Heroku cloud platform:

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java

## Technical problems I encountered during installation of the software development environment and how I have solved them
Unable to use Git Bash as terminal, some heroku commands did not work. Fixed by using normal cmd.

## How I have validated (checked) that the software development environment is working
First set up heroku local, and then deploy and checked using Heroku URL listed at bottom.

## Technical problems encountered with the Heroku platform and how I solved them
No technical problems.

## Any pending issues with this assignment which I did not manage to solve
Did not add method for inserting values into db table. Unsure of where to put the code-snippet in the project-dir.

## Heroku URL: https://whispering-falls-72273.herokuapp.com/
